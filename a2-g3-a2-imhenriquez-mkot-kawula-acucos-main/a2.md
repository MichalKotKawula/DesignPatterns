# A2 - Reflection and Demo Link

## Reflection

### What was the most challenging part of the assignment?
The most challenging part of this assignment was getting the Remove last border button to work properly, 

### What was the most interesting thing you learned from this assignment?
The most intersting thing about this assignemnt was working with p5.js and learing how to work with a decorator pattern. 
We found working with the decorator pattern to be very interesting and we were able to learn a lot about it.
Since decorators allow us to add functionality to an object without changing the object itself we found that to be very intriguing.

### GOF describes the Decorator as having the following participants: Component, Concrete Component, Decorator, Concrete Decorator(s). Did changing the language to JavaScript change this? If yes, describe the change and why it was useful and/or necessary. If no, Identify the participants in your code

Since javascript is a prototypal language, we did not need to use the abstract class component. Instead we used the prototype object to create the decorator pattern. 
By extending on the prototype object we were able to dynamically make changes to draw() during runtime in order to create AddThinBorder(), AddThickBorder(), and AddDottedBorder().
